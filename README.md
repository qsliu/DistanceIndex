# Distance Index

Jay Lee teaches at Kent State University and is an active practitioner of spatio-temporal geography. He has proposed a series of improvements to the traditional geographic index by adding a temporal dimension. 

This program is an implementation of his published article.

 It is implemented in the form of an open source QGIS plug-in, so the plug-in is also open source. You can download it for improvement. This program will be included in Jay Lee publications, please cite the source if you use it. If you have any questions, please contact Qingsong Liu (qliu20@kent.edu).
